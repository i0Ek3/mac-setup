# Tmux

Tmux is really awesome reuse tools for developers and others.
```Shell
$ brew install tmux
```

When done,you just need to get tmux.conf* files and copy them into home path follows:
```Shell
$ cp tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
$ cp tmux.conf.local ~/.tmux.conf.local
```

Other hand,you can customlize conf files as your habbits,enjoy~
